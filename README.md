# Day 1 Project: Band Name Generator
Part of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023  https://100daysofpython.dev/

Using what I have learned from Day 1 and showcase simple user input and out return.

In this project I will show my knowledge for printing messages to User, receiving User input and storing input into variables, and then calling on those variables to return a message back to User.

You can do a lot with this knowledge. Try out different variations to include:
  -  What would your Pirate name be ? 
  - What would your DJ name be ?
set funny variables/ questions for User to respond to
